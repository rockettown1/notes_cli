# Notes CLI

## Instructions

- Fork the repository to your own account
- Clone the code to your own machine
- run ```npm i``` to get the dependencies
- create a ```.env``` file, add an environment variable called MONGO_URI and store a connection string to a MongoDB database (this is exactly the same as the other apps you've done this week)
- run the app using the command ```npm run app```
